## How it works

### Problem

Npm packages are mutable which means they can be changed and thus break existing software.

Software can be explained like a lego castle, each piece of lego is put together to build the castle much like pieces of code ,or packages, can be put together to build a software application.

If we remove a block of lego from the base of the castle we jeopardize the structural integrity of the castle and it may break and fall.

The same occurs with software, if we change or remove a package from the software application it may break or stop running.

This [article](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/) unpacks an example of how this small problem can break most of modern day JavaScript.

### Solution

Insert Immutable Node Package Manager ü§Ø

A dead simple npm wrapper that installs the package from arweave an immutable data storage solution leveraging blockchain technology. This tool understands the market adoption of the public npm registry and so is not a replacement but acts as an improvement where by it downloads the package from arweave first and if the package is not found in arweave it falls back to a regular npm request.

Example usage `inpm install arql-ops`

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo ‚§¥Ô∏è
2. Build the program

```
npm run babel
```

3. Make the package executable

```
chmod +x ./bin/cli.js
```

4. Add the package to your system (equivalent to `npm i -g ...`)

```
npm link
```

5. Test by installing some package

```
inpm install ghost-busters
```

## Usage

```
inpm install ghost-busters
```

```
inpm install arql-ops
```

```
inpm {any other normal npm command}
```

```
inpm --help
```

```
inpm --version
```

## Further work

- Refactor into ReasonML (Functional typed language I would like to get more familiar with) - [binding](https://github.com/cometkim/bs-ink)

- Expand on npm functionality

- Cache previously used commands (speed improvement)

- Allow configurable underlying package manager so that users can switch between yarn and npm as the underlying tool

- Change the name to something that is equally simple and doesn't conflict with [inpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inpm). Part of me wishes I could contact the developer of `inpm` (npm registry version) and ask to take the name but that would truly go against exactly the problem this package solves üòÇ
